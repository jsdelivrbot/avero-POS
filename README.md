# The Greasy Spoon - POS System
Fun coding challenge, built using React and Redux.

The challenge required that I create a POS system for servers at a restaurant to use. The servers had to be able to open a new check against a table, add menu items to the check, void items from the check if necessary, and close out the check when they are finished.

## Getting Started
Just follow the steps below to get started!

```
> git clone https://github.com/miketheo423/avero-POS.git

> npm install
> npm start
> navigate to localhost:8080
